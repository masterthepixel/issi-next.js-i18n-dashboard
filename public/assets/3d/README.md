# Basic Bar 3D Model

This is a placeholder - you'll need to create or obtain the actual bar.glb file.
The component above creates the geometry programmatically, so this file is optional
but may be needed for future enhancements.

## To create a proper bar.glb file, you can

1. Use Blender to create a rounded rectangle/pill shape
2. Export as GLB format
3. Place in this directory

For now, the component uses a programmatically generated geometry.
