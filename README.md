## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- pnpm 8.x or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/issi-next.js-i18n-dashboard.git
   cd issi-next.js-i18n-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Approve necessary build scripts:

   ```bash
   # When prompted about "unrs-resolver", you should approve it
   # This is a dependency related to Next.js URL resolution
   pnpm approve unrs-resolver
   ```

   > Note: pnpm's security feature requires explicit approval to run scripts from dependencies. The `unrs-resolver` is safe to approve as it's related to Next.js functionality.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Tailwind CSS Debug Screens

This project includes a **responsive breakpoint indicator** that shows the current Tailwind CSS breakpoint in the bottom-left corner during development.

#### Features

- üì± **Real-time indicator**: Shows current breakpoint (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- üéØ **Unobtrusive**: Small indicator that doesn't interfere with your layout
- üîÑ **Live updates**: Changes automatically when you resize the browser window

#### Production Deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The debug indicator is currently always enabled. To disable it in production:

**Option 1: Environment-based (Recommended)**

```tsx
// In src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx
<body className={`relative min-h-screen overflow-y-auto grid-background-with-fade flex flex-col ${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'debug-screens' : ''}`}>
```

**Option 2: Manual removal**

```tsx
// Remove 'debug-screens' from the className
<body className="relative min-h-screen overflow-y-auto grid-background-with-fade flex flex-col">
```

üìñ **[Full Debug Screens Documentation](./docs/TAILWIND_DEBUG_SCREENS.md)**

## Testing

### Product URL Testing

The project includes automated testing scripts to verify that all product pages in the BentoGrid are accessible and return proper responses:

#### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test all English product URLs only (30 URLs)
npm run test:products

# Test all product URLs across all locales (90 URLs)
npm run test:products:all

# Test actual URLs generated by BentoGrid cards (recommended for debugging)
node test-actual-product-urls.js
```

#### What Gets Tested

- **All 30 product pages** from the BentoGrid component
- **Multiple locales**: English (`/en/`), Spanish (`/es/`), French (`/fr/`)
- **HTTP response validation**: Ensures each URL returns 200 OK status
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Every product card in the grid has a working dedicated page
- **SEO-friendly URLs**: All products use proper slugs (e.g., `/en/products/grant-management-system`)

#### Test Results

‚úÖ **100% Success Rate** - All 30 products √ó 3 locales = 90 working URLs

#### Example Output

```console
üöÄ Testing all product URLs...

[1/30] Testing: gms -> grant-management-system
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS
[2/30] Testing: ects -> electronic-correspondence-tracking-system
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS
...

üìä SUMMARY:
‚úÖ Successful: 30/30 (100%)
üéØ Perfect accessibility for all products!
```

üëâ **[Full Testing Documentation](./docs/PRODUCT_URL_TESTING.md)**

## Internationalization

The website supports multiple languages through a custom i18n implementation:

- Language files are stored in `src/lang` directory
- Language switching is available in the UI
- Default language detection is handled via browser preferences

To add or modify translations, edit the JSON files in the language directories.
