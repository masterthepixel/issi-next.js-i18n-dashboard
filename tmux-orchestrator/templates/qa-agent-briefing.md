#### 2. Product URL Validation

Use the automated testing scripts:

```bash
# Test all English product URLs (30 URLs)
npm run test:products

# Test all product URLs across all locales (90 URLs)
npm run test:products:all

# Test actual URLs generated by BentoGrid
node test-actual-product-urls.js
```

#### 3. Component Integration Testing

5. Report bugs to appropriate development agents
6. Verify bug fixes when implemented
7. Approve feature for integration

#### 2. Regression Testing (After Changes)

1. Run automated URL validation tests
2. Execute core user journey tests
3. Verify critical functionality unchanged
4. Test language switching still works
5. Confirm no new accessibility issues
6. Validate performance hasn't degraded

#### 3. Release Testing (Pre-deployment)

1. Complete system test across all browsers
2. Mobile device testing (iOS/Android)
3. Performance benchmark comparison
4. Security vulnerability scan
5. Final accessibility audit
6. Sign-off approval for deployment

## Coordination with Development Agents

### Frontend Agent Coordination

- **Component Testing**: Test new components immediately after completion
- **UI/UX Feedback**: Provide user experience insights
- **Accessibility Guidance**: Ensure WCAG compliance from start

### Backend Agent Coordination

- **Deployment Verification**: Confirm deployed version matches expected

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Critical Issues (Stop Development)

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Immediate escalation to Project Manager
2. **Data Loss/Corruption**: Stop all work, preserve evidence
3. **Complete System Failure**: Document exact steps to reproduce
4. **Accessibility Violations**: Block deployment until resolved

### Documentation Testing Workflow

#### 1. Feature Testing (New Development)

1. Review feature documentation before testing
2. Create test cases based on documented specifications
3. Test implementation against documentation
4. Report discrepancies as documentation bugs
5. Verify fixes match updated documentation

#### 2. Regression Testing (After Changes)

1. Validate that existing documentation still matches functionality
2. Test that changes don't break documented behavior
3. Update tests if documentation changes
4. Ensure all languages still work as documented

#### 3. Release Testing (Pre-deployment)

1. Complete documentation accuracy audit
2. Validate all documented URLs work correctly
3. Test all documented features across all languages
4. Confirm documentation matches deployed functionality
5. Sign-off on documentation quality

**Remember**: Documentation is the source of truth for testing. If documentation is wrong, the tests will be wrong. Your validation ensures the entire team works from accurate, complete documentation.
