feat(ui): Remove redundant hover text from Government Clients section

- Removed the "Hover over a row to pause animation" text from the Government Clients component
- Keeps the interface cleaner and less cluttered
- Functionality (pause on hover) still works as expected without explicit instructions
- Updated CLAUDEMEMORY.md to document this change

This change completes one of the pending tasks identified in the roadmap for
improving the Government Clients section user interface.
