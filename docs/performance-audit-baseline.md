# Performance Audit Report - Baseline Metrics

## Executive Summary

Initial performance audit completed. Current metrics show significant room for improvement across all Core Web Vitals. Bundle analysis reveals excessive JavaScript payload and inefficient chunk splitting.

## Current Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals (Target vs Current)

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Target <2.5s | Current: 9.849s ❌
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Target <1.8s | Current: 2.948s ❌
- **Page Size**: Target <1.5MB | Current: 3.37MB ❌
- **JavaScript Bundle**: Target <1MB | Current: 1.65MB (49.07% of page size) ❌

### Bundle Analysis Results

#### Overall Bundle Composition

- **First Load JS (shared)**: 608 kB (loaded on every page)
- **Total Shared Chunks**: 217 kB
- **Vendor Chunks**: 20+ separate chunks (inefficient splitting)
- **Largest Individual Pages**:
  - `/products`: 13.1 kB
  - `/services`: 8.68 kB
  - `/careers`: 7.92 kB
  - `/about`: 5.97 kB

#### Bundle Analyzer Findings

- Bundle analyzer reports generated: `client.html` and `edge.html`
- Excessive vendor chunk splitting (20+ chunks) indicates over-optimization
- Large shared bundle (608 kB) suggests insufficient code splitting
- No evidence of dynamic imports for heavy components

## Prioritized Hotspots

### 🔥 Critical Issues (Immediate Impact)

1. **Massive JavaScript Payload** (Priority: Critical)

   - 608 kB shared bundle + 217 kB shared chunks = 825 kB baseline
   - 20+ vendor chunks indicate poor consolidation
   - Impact: Slow initial load, high memory usage

2. **Missing Code Splitting** (Priority: Critical)

   - No dynamic imports visible in build output
   - Heavy components (3D elements, carousels, team grids) loaded eagerly
   - Impact: Unnecessary JavaScript execution on every page

3. **Inefficient Chunk Splitting** (Priority: High)
   - Too many small vendor chunks (10-15 kB each)
   - Better consolidation could reduce HTTP requests
   - Impact: Increased network overhead

### 🟡 High Priority Issues

4. **Image Optimization Gap** (Priority: High)

   - No evidence of WebP/AVIF conversion in build
   - Raw `<img>` tags likely used instead of Next.js Image
   - Impact: Larger image payloads, slower LCP

5. **Missing Lazy Loading** (Priority: High)
   - No lazy loading implementation visible
   - All resources load immediately
   - Impact: Blocking main thread unnecessarily

### 🟠 Medium Priority Issues

6. **Asset 404 Errors** (Priority: Medium)

   - Build completed with warnings but no 404 tracking
   - TeamGrid and other components may reference missing assets
   - Impact: Additional loading time, poor UX

7. **Render-Blocking Resources** (Priority: Medium)
   - No critical CSS inlining visible
   - Font loading strategy not optimized
   - Impact: Delayed visual feedback

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Implement Dynamic Imports**: Convert heavy components to `next/dynamic`
2. **Consolidate Vendor Chunks**: Tune webpack splitChunks configuration
3. **Add Lazy Loading**: Implement `loading="lazy"` for images and components

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)

4. **Image Optimization**: Convert to WebP/AVIF, adopt Next.js Image component
5. **Critical CSS**: Inline above-the-fold styles
6. **Font Optimization**: Implement `font-display: swap`

### Long-term (Weeks 4-5)

7. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular monitoring with performance budgets
8. **CDN Optimization**: Configure caching headers
9. **Monitoring**: Implement Web Vitals tracking

## Success Criteria Validation

- [ ] Bundle analyzer reports generated and analyzed
- [ ] Hotspots identified and prioritized
- [ ] Baseline metrics documented
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with dynamic imports (Todo 2)
2. Tune webpack configuration (Todo 3)
3. Run iterative benchmarks after each change
4. Track progress against targets
