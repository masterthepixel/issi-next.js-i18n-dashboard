### 6. Constraints & Dependencies

#### 6.1. Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The blog must be built using the existing technology stack: Next.js, PayloadCMS, and TypeScript.
* **Design System:** The blog must adhere to the existing website's design system and branding guidelines.
* **Budget:** The project must be completed within the allocated budget for development resources.
* **Timeline:** The initial version (MVP) should be launched within a 10-week timeframe.

#### 6.2. Dependencies

* **PayloadCMS:** The entire blog's backend and content management capabilities depend on PayloadCMS.
* **Next.js i18n:** The blog's frontend structure depends on the existing internationalization setup in Next.js.
* **Content Team:** The success of the blog is dependent on the content team's ability to produce high-quality, consistent content.
* **Design Resources:** Any custom UI elements or pages will require input from the design team.

---

### 7. High-Level Technical Architecture Overview

The blog will be a fully integrated part of the existing Next.js and PayloadCMS monorepo.

* **Backend (PayloadCMS):**
  * A new collection, `Posts`, will be defined in the `cms/collections` directory.
  * This collection will define the schema for blog posts, including fields like `title`, `slug`, `content` (rich text), `excerpt`, `author` (relationship to `Users`), `publishedAt`, `featuredImage` (relationship to a `Media` collection), and `tags`.
  * Payload's Admin UI will serve as the content management interface.
  * Payload will automatically generate REST/GraphQL endpoints for the `Posts` collection, which will be consumed by the Next.js frontend.

* **Frontend (Next.js):**
  * Two new page structures will be added to the `src/app/[lang]` directory:
    * `blog/page.tsx`: The blog index page. This page will fetch a list of posts from the PayloadCMS API at build time (using `getStaticProps`) and display them.
    * `blog/[slug]/page.tsx`: The dynamic blog post detail page. This page will fetch the data for a single post based on the `slug` from the URL at build time (`getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`).
  * Reusable React components will be created to render the post list, post content, author bio, and other UI elements.
  * The rich text content from PayloadCMS will be rendered using a suitable library (e.g., a serializer for the chosen rich text editor like Slate or Lexical).
  * The existing i18n setup will be leveraged to handle the `lang` parameter in the URL.

* **Data Flow:**
    1. Content creators use the PayloadCMS Admin UI to create and manage posts.
    2. During the Next.js build process, the frontend fetches data from the PayloadCMS API.
    3. Next.js statically generates the blog pages, ensuring fast load times.
    4. Users navigate to the blog on the live website, served by the Next.js application.
