### 2. PayloadCMS Backend & Admin Experience

#### 2.1. `Posts` Collection Setup

*   **Story B-001 (P0):** As a Developer, I want to define a `Posts` collection in PayloadCMS using the `payloadcms-localization-reference` as a blueprint, so that I have a structured, i18n-ready way to store blog post data.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A new file `cms/collections/Posts.ts` is created, adapting the structure from `docs/reference-repos/payloadcms-localization-reference/src/collections/Posts/index.ts`.
        *   The collection is registered in `payload.config.ts`.
        *   The collection includes fields: `title` (text, required, localized), `slug` (text, required, unique, localized), `content` (richText, required, localized, editor: lexical), `excerpt` (textarea, localized), `publishedAt` (date), `author` (relationship to `users`), `featuredImage` (relationship to `media`), `status` (select: `draft`, `published`).
        *   The `slug` field uses a hook to auto-generate from the `title` field, as shown in the reference.

*   **Story B-002 (P1):** As a Content Creator, I want to see a clear and user-friendly admin UI for creating and editing blog posts, so that I can easily manage content.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `Posts` collection is visible in the Payload Admin UI.
        *   The default list view shows `title`, `status`, `author`, and `publishedAt` columns.
        *   The create/edit form is logically grouped (e.g., Main Content, Metadata, Publishing).
        *   The rich text editor is functional and includes standard formatting options.

*   **Story B-003 (P2):** As a Content Creator, I want to be able to save a post as a draft, so that I can work on it over time without publishing it.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `status` field has a `draft` option.
        *   Posts with `draft` status are not visible on the live frontend.
        *   The "Save Draft" button is clearly available.

*   **Story B-004 (P2):** As a Content Creator, I want to schedule a post for future publication, so that I can plan my content calendar in advance.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `publishedAt` date field allows setting a future date and time.
        *   A post with a future `publishedAt` date and `published` status is not visible on the frontend until that date/time.
        *   PayloadCMS's internal cron job or a similar mechanism handles the automated publishing.

#### 2.2. Media Management

*   **Story B-005 (P1):** As a Content Creator, I want to upload and select a featured image for my blog post, so that I can make my posts more visually appealing.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A `Media` collection exists and is configured in PayloadCMS.
        *   The `featuredImage` field in the `Posts` collection allows selecting an image from the `Media` collection.
        *   Image uploads are functional and support common formats (JPG, PNG, WebP).

### 3. Next.js Frontend & User Experience

#### 3.1. Blog Index Page (`/[lang]/blog`)

*   **Story B-006 (P0):** As a Visitor, I want to view a list of published blog posts on the blog index page, so that I can browse the available content.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A page exists at `src/app/[lang]/blog/page.tsx`.
        *   The page uses `generateStaticParams` to pre-render pages for all supported languages, similar to `docs/reference-repos/payloadcms-localization-reference/src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/posts/page.tsx`.
        *   The page fetches a paginated list of posts from the PayloadCMS API (`/api/posts?locale=${lang}&page=1&limit=10&where[status][equals]=published`).
        *   Only posts with `published` status and a `publishedAt` date in the past are shown.
        *   Each post in the list displays the title, excerpt, author name, publication date, and featured image URL.
        *   The list is paginated using a `Pagination` component, adapted from the reference.

*   **Story B-007 (P1):** As a Visitor, I want to click on a post in the list to be taken to its full detail page, so that I can read the entire article.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Each post item in the list is a clickable link.
        *   The link correctly points to the `/[lang]/blog/[slug]` page for that specific post.

#### 3.2. Blog Post Detail Page (`/[lang]/blog/[slug]`)

*   **Story B-008 (P0):** As a Visitor, I want to view the full content of a single blog post on a dedicated page, so that I can read the article in its entirety.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A dynamic page exists at `src/app/[lang]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`.
        *   The page uses `generateStaticParams` to pre-render all post slugs for all languages, fetching slugs from the Payload API, as shown in `docs/reference-repos/payloadcms-localization-reference/src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`.
        *   The page fetches the correct post based on the `slug` and `lang` from the PayloadCMS API (`/api/posts/${slug}?locale=${lang}`).
        *   The page displays the post title, featured image, author name, publication date, and the full rich text content rendered using the `RichText` component from the reference.
        *   If a post with the given `slug` does not exist or is not published, the `notFound()` function is called to render the 404 page.

*   **Story B-009 (P2):** As a Visitor, I want to see meta tags for SEO on the blog post page, so that the page is well-represented when shared on social media or found by search engines.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The page dynamically generates `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`) based on the post's data.

#### 3.3. Navigation and Layout

*   **Story B-010 (P1):** As a Visitor, I want a "Blog" link in the main website navigation, so that I can easily find the blog from any page.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A link labeled "Blog" is added to the main navigation component.
        *   The link correctly points to `/[lang]/blog` for the current active language.

*   **Story B-011 (P2):** As a Visitor, I want the blog pages to have a consistent layout and styling with the rest of the website, so that it feels like a cohesive part of the site.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The blog index and post detail pages use the site's main layout (header, footer).
        *   Typography, colors, and spacing are consistent with the existing design system (Shadcn/ui).

### 4. Internationalization (i18n)

*   **Story B-012 (P0):** As a Visitor, I want to be able to view the blog in all supported languages, so that the content is accessible to a global audience.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The blog index and post detail pages are generated statically for all locales defined in the project's i18n configuration.
        *   The content (title, excerpt, body) displayed on the frontend matches the language of the URL's `[lang]` segment.
        *   If a post does not have a translation for the current language, it should gracefully fall back to a default language or show a "not available in this language" message.

*   **Story B-013 (P1):** As a Content Creator, I want to manage translations for my blog posts directly in the PayloadCMS admin, so that I can provide content in multiple languages.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   In the PayloadCMS admin, when editing a post, there is a clear way to switch between languages to edit the localized fields (`title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `content`).
        *   The admin UI clearly indicates which fields are localized.

### 5. Search Functionality

*   **Story B-014 (P2):** As a Visitor, I want a search bar on the blog index page, so that I can search for blog posts by keywords.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A search form is present on the blog index page.
        *   The form uses a Server Action to handle the search submission.
        *   The Server Action, adapted from `docs/reference-repos/payloadcms-localization-reference/src/search/search.ts`, queries the PayloadCMS Local API.
        *   The search filters posts by the search term within the current language's `title`, `excerpt`, and `content` fields.
        *   The blog index page re-renders to display the list of posts matching the search query, or a "no results found" message.

*   **Story B-015 (P3):** As a Visitor, I want search results to be highlighted, so that I can easily see why a particular post was returned in the results.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   In the search results list, the matching keywords within the post title or excerpt are highlighted (e.g., in bold).

*   **Story B-017 (P3):** As a Visitor, I want to subscribe to an email newsletter to be notified of new posts.
*   **Story B-018 (P3):** As a Content Creator, I want to categorize and tag posts, so that content can be filtered and browsed by topic.
*   **Story B-019 (P3):** As a Content Creator, I want to see analytics on post views and engagement, so that I can understand what content resonates with the audience.
