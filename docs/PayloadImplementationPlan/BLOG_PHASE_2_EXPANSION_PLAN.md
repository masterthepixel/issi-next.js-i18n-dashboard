### 3. New Components & Page Structure

This section details the new frontend components and page routes that need to be created.

#### 3.1. New Components (`src/components/blog/`)

| Component Name | Description | Priority | Design System Integration | Reference/Inspiration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CategoryList.tsx` | A component to display a list of all available categories, likely in the sidebar or footer. | P1 | Use `Button` or `Link` components from Shadcn/ui for category links. Style with Tailwind using theme variables. | `job-marshal-finale-locale-main/components/general/` for list styling patterns. |
| `CategoryFilter.tsx` | A component (e.g., a dropdown or a list of checkboxes) to allow users to filter the blog index page by one or more categories. | P1 | Use Shadcn/ui `Checkbox` or `Select` components. Style with Tailwind using theme variables. | `payloadcms-localization-reference` for how to construct `where` clauses for API calls. |
| `AuthorCard.tsx` | A reusable card component to display an author's avatar, name, and short bio. Can be used on post detail pages and author archive pages. | P1 | Use `Card`, `Avatar` components from Shadcn/ui. Style with Tailwind using theme variables. | `job-marshal-finale-locale-main/components/general/JobCard.tsx` for card structure. |
| `RelatedPosts.tsx` | A component to display a list of posts related to the one currently being viewed, based on shared categories or tags. | P2 | Reuse the `BlogPostCard.tsx` component (from Phase 1) for each related post item. | `payloadcms-localization-reference/src/blocks/RelatedPosts/` for a direct implementation example. |
| `PostHero.tsx` | A component for a visually rich hero section at the top of individual blog post pages, featuring the title, featured image, author, and date in a prominent layout. | P2 | Use `Badge` for date/category tags, `Avatar` for author image. Style with Tailwind using theme variables for a visually striking layout. | `payloadcms-localization-reference/src/heros/PostHero/` for a direct implementation example. |
| `NewsletterSignup.tsx` | A component with a form for users to subscribe to a newsletter. This will save emails to a new `NewsletterSubscriptions` collection in PayloadCMS. | P3 | Use `Input`, `Button` components from Shadcn/ui for the form. Style with Tailwind using theme variables. | `job-marshal-finale-locale-main/components/forms/` for form structure and validation patterns. Adapt to save to PayloadCMS. |

#### 3.2. New Page Routes (`src/app/[lang]/blog/`)

| Page Route | Description | Priority | Design System Integration | Reference/Inspiration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `category/[slug]/page.tsx` | A dynamic page to display all posts belonging to a specific category. It will need to fetch posts based on the category slug. | P1 | Reuse `BlogPostCard.tsx` (Phase 1) and `Pagination.tsx` (Phase 1). Use `Heading` components for page titles. Style with Tailwind theme variables. | `payloadcms-localization-reference/src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/posts/page.tsx` for paginated lists, adapting the `where` clause for category filtering. |
| `author/[slug]/page.tsx` | A dynamic page to display an author's profile (bio, avatar, social links) and a list of all posts they have written. | P1 | Reuse `AuthorCard.tsx` (new, Phase 2), `BlogPostCard.tsx` (Phase 1), and `Pagination.tsx` (Phase 1). Style with Tailwind theme variables. | Similar to the category page, but filtering by author. The author's bio can be fetched from the `users` collection in Payload. |

### 5. Implementation Strategy & Phasing

#### 5.1. Phase 2.1: Core Organization (P1 Features)

This phase focuses on the foundational elements for content organization and author branding.

*   **Goals:**
  * Implement the category and tag system in PayloadCMS.
  * Update the `Posts` collection to relate to categories and tags.
  * Create the `CategoryList.tsx` and `CategoryFilter.tsx` components.
  * Build the `category/[slug]/page.tsx` and `author/[slug]/page.tsx` dynamic pages.
  * Create the `AuthorCard.tsx` component.
  * **Note:** This phase assumes the author data structure question (Section 4.4) has been resolved.
  * Seed initial categories, tags, and sample content.
*   **Success Metrics:**
*   Content creators can successfully assign categories and tags to posts.
*   Users can navigate to category and author archive pages.
*   Posts on the index page can be filtered by category.
*   Sample content demonstrates all blog features working correctly.

#### 5.2. Phase 2.2: Enhanced UX & Engagement (P2/P3 Features)

This phase focuses on improving the user experience and adding features to grow the audience.

*   **Goals:**
    *   Implement the `RelatedPosts.tsx` component.
    *   Create and integrate the `PostHero.tsx` component.
    *   Implement the `NewsletterSignup.tsx` component and integrate it with a chosen service.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   An increase in pages per session, indicating users are exploring more content via related posts.
    *   A visually appealing and consistent post layout with the hero section.
    *   Growth in the newsletter subscriber count.

### 6. Technical Implementation Notes

#### 6.1. Fresh Start Advantages

Since we have no existing content to migrate, we can:

*   **Optimize data structure** from the start with categories and tags
*   **Implement clean URL patterns** without legacy redirects
*   **Establish consistent content workflows** immediately
*   **Create comprehensive seed data** for testing and demonstration

#### 6.2. Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Backend Collections** (Categories, Tags, Posts updates)
2. **Content Seeding** (Sample data for testing)
3. **Core Components** (CategoryList, CategoryFilter, AuthorCard)
4. **Archive Pages** (Category and Author pages)
5. **Enhanced Components** (RelatedPosts, PostHero)
6. **Newsletter Integration** (Final phase)

### 7. Open Questions & Dependencies

*   **Newsletter Service Integration:** While we are storing emails in PayloadCMS initially, do we have a long-term preference for a third-party service (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit) for advanced email campaign management? The `NewsletterSignup.tsx` component should be built with this potential future integration in mind.
*   **Design Assets:** Are there specific design mocks or style guide entries for the new components like `PostHero` or `NewsletterSignup`? While we will adhere to the existing design system (Shadcn/ui, Tailwind theme variables), specific mocks would accelerate development.
*   **Content Strategy:** The initial categories, tags, authors, and fake posts have been defined (Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5). This dependency is now resolved.
*   **Content Strategy:** What categories and tags should we seed initially to match ISSI's business focus?
  * **→ RESOLVED:** See Section 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 for recommended initial categories and tags.

### 8. Conclusion

This Phase 2 Expansion Plan provides a clear roadmap for evolving the blog from a simple MVP into a feature-rich platform. By focusing on content organization, user experience, and audience growth, these enhancements will significantly increase the blog's value and effectiveness as a marketing and engagement tool.

**Key Advantage:** Starting with no existing content allows us to implement best practices from day one and create a solid foundation for scalable content management.
