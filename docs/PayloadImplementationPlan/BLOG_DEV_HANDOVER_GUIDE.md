### 3. Required Reading & Key Documents

Before you write a single line of code, you **must** read the following documents in order. They contain the "why" and "what" behind your work.

1.  **[`BLOG_PRD.md`](BLOG_PRD.md):** The Product Requirements Document. Understand the business goals, target audience, and overall vision for the blog.
2.  **[`BLOG_USER_STORIES.md`](sharded-stories/BLOG_USER_STORIES.md):** The sharded user stories. These are your primary acceptance criteria. Each story defines a specific piece of functionality from a user's perspective.
3.  **[`BLOG_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](technical-design/BLOG_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md):** The high-level technical design. This covers the architecture, data models, and key technical decisions.
4.  **[`BLOG_DEV_COMPANION_GUIDE.md`](developer-companion/BLOG_DEV_COMPANION_GUIDE.md):** Your best friend during development. This guide provides specific, code-level instructions, file paths, and direct references to our example repositories (`payloadcms-localization-reference` and `job-marshal-finale-locale-main`). **Consult this document often.**
5.  **[`BLOG_PHASE_2_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`](BLOG_PHASE_2_EXPANSION_PLAN.md):** The detailed plan for Phase 2. Read this to understand the full roadmap, but focus on Phase 1 first.

### 5. The Developer's Roadmap: Phase 2 (Expansion)

#### **Phase 2 Task List (High-Level)**

### 6. How to Work: Best Practices & Guidelines

*   **Reference Repositories are Your Blueprint:** The `payloadcms-localization-reference` and `job-marshal-finale-locale-main` repos are not just inspiration; they are your source of truth for implementation patterns. The `BLOG_DEV_COMPANION_GUIDE.md` will point you to the exact files you need.
*   **Component-First:** Build reusable components. If you find yourself writing the same JSX twice, refactor it into a component.
*   **Shadcn/ui & Theme Variables:** Do not hardcode styles. Use the components from `src/components/ui/` and for custom styles, use Tailwind classes with the theme variables defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **Localization is Non-Negotiable:** Every piece of text and every data field that can be localized, should be. Follow the patterns in `payloadcms-localization-reference`.
*   **Test as You Go:** Don't wait until the end. After completing a user story, manually test it. Create a post, view it, check the links, etc.
*   **Communicate:** If a requirement is unclear, a technical decision is difficult, or you discover a blocker, raise it immediately. The planning docs are comprehensive, but unforeseen issues always arise.

### 7. Kickoff Meeting Agenda

To ensure everyone is aligned, we should hold a kickoff meeting. The agenda should be:

1.  **Quick Review:** Walkthrough of this handover document.
2.  **Q&A:** Open floor for any questions on the PRD, user stories, or technical design.
3.  **Task Breakdown & Estimation:** The dev team breaks down the Phase 1 task list into smaller sub-tasks and provides time estimates.
4.  **Define "Done":** Agree on the definition of "done" for each task and for the MVP as a whole.
5.  **Tooling & Process:** Confirm the process for task tracking (using the `update_todo_list` tool), code reviews, and merging.
