### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Product Vision
To create a centralized, efficient, and branded job portal that streamlines our internal hiring process, attracts a high volume of qualified external talent, and establishes our company as a premier destination for industry professionals. The portal will serve as the primary channel for all our job postings, reducing reliance on third-party boards and building a strong talent pipeline for current and future openings.

#### 1.2. Problem Statement
Our current hiring process is fragmented, relying on multiple external job boards and manual tracking systems. This leads to inefficiencies, high costs, inconsistent candidate experience, and a lack of a centralized talent pool. We need a single, integrated platform to manage job postings, applications, and the review workflow effectively.

#### 1.3. Goals & OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

*   **Objective 1:** Streamline the internal hiring process and reduce time-to-hire.
    *   **KR1:** Reduce the average time-to-hire by 25% within 6 months of portal launch.
    *   **KR2:** Decrease cost-per-hire attributed to job board fees by 80% within 12 months.
*   **Objective 2:** Attract a high volume of qualified and diverse candidates.
    *   **KR1:** Increase the number of qualified applications per job opening by 50% within 6 months.
    *   **KR2:** Achieve a 30% increase in applications from underrepresented groups within 12 months.
*   **Objective 3:** Enhance our employer brand and build a strong talent community.
    *   **KR1:** Achieve a 4.5/5 average satisfaction rating from candidates on the application experience within 6 months.
    *   **KR2:** Grow the internal talent pipeline (candidate database) by 200% within 12 months.

### 6. Constraints & Dependencies

#### 6.1. Constraints
*   **Technology Stack:** The portal must be built using the existing technology stack: Next.js, PayloadCMS, and TypeScript.
*   **Internal Use Only:** Job postings are exclusively for our company's own open positions. No external company postings.
*   **Budget:** The project must be completed within the allocated budget for development resources.
*   **Timeline:** The initial version (MVP) should be launched within a 16-week timeframe.

#### 6.2. Dependencies
*   **PayloadCMS:** The backend, user management, and data models will depend heavily on PayloadCMS.
*   **Next.js:** The frontend will be built with Next.js, leveraging its features for routing and data fetching.
*   **Internal Stakeholders:** Success depends on the adoption and consistent use of the portal by HR and hiring managers.
*   **Existing Infrastructure:** The portal will need to be integrated with existing company authentication (SSO if available) and potentially other internal systems.

---

### 7. High-Level Technical Architecture Overview

The Job Portal will be a new application within the existing Next.js and PayloadCMS monorepo.

*   **Backend (PayloadCMS):**
    *   **Collections:** New Payload collections will be created:
        *   `Users`: Extended to support different roles (Job Seeker, HR Manager, Hiring Manager, Admin). This will be the single source of truth for all users, potentially integrating with or replacing the existing `Users` collection if a unified user system is desired.
        *   `Jobs`: To store job listings with all specified fields.
        *   `Applications`: To store applications, linking a `User` (job seeker) to a `Job`. This collection will also store the application status, resume file path, cover letter, etc.
        *   `ApplicationStatusLogs`: To store the audit trail for status changes.
    *   **Access Control:** Payload's built-in access control will be configured to enforce role-based permissions for reading/writing to collections. For example, Job Seekers can create applications but not read other users' applications, while HR Managers can read applications for jobs they manage.
    *   **Hooks:** Payload hooks will be used to automate tasks like sending notifications (email/in-app) upon status changes or new application submissions.
    *   **Endpoints:** Payload will auto-generate REST/GraphQL APIs for all collections, which will be consumed by the Next.js frontend. The API will be the primary means of integration between the frontend and backend.
    *   **Internationalization (i18n):** While initial content is primarily internal, any public-facing text (e.g., on job descriptions, application forms) should be structured to support i18n, potentially leveraging the existing Next.js i18n framework if public-facing localization is a future goal. For the MVP, the primary language will be English.

*   **Frontend (Next.js):**
    *   **Page Structure:** New page structures will be added under a `/careers` path (e.g., `/careers`, `/careers/[slug]`, `/careers/apply/[slug]`, `/dashboard`). A dedicated dashboard area will be created for authenticated internal users (HR, Hiring Managers, Admins).
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** NextAuth.js will be configured to handle user authentication, integrating with the PayloadCMS `Users` collection. The frontend will use session data to determine the user's role and conditionally render UI components and protect routes (e.g., redirecting unauthenticated users from the dashboard).
    *   **Role-Based UI:** The frontend will render different components, layouts, and dashboards based on the authenticated user's role (Job Seeker, HR Manager, Hiring Manager, Admin).
    *   **Components:** Reusable components will be built for job cards, application forms, status pipelines, dashboards, file uploaders, etc. These components will adhere to the project's design system for consistency.
    *   **File Uploads:** Resume uploads will be handled by posting directly to Payload's upload endpoints or through a Next.js API route that proxies the request to Payload, with frontend validation for file type (PDF, DOCX) and size (e.g., 5MB).
    *   **API Communication:** The frontend will use `fetch` or a dedicated API client to communicate with the PayloadCMS REST/GraphQL endpoints for all data operations (fetching jobs, submitting applications, updating status, etc.).

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  **User Authentication:** A user attempts to log in. NextAuth.js sends credentials to PayloadCMS. Upon successful authentication, Payload returns a user object with role information. NextAuth.js creates a session.
    2.  **Internal User (HR/Hiring Manager/Admin):**
        a.  The user navigates to a protected dashboard route.
        b.  The frontend checks the session. If authenticated and authorized, it fetches relevant data (e.g., job postings, applications) from the Payload API.
        c.  The user interacts with the dashboard (e.g., reviews an application, updates its status). The frontend sends a PUT/PATCH request to the Payload API.
        d.  Payload updates the data in the database. A Payload hook triggers a notification (e.g., an email to the candidate).
    3.  **External User (Job Seeker):**
        a.  The user navigates to public pages (e.g., `/careers`). The frontend fetches active job listings from the Payload API.
        b.  The user views a job detail page and clicks "Apply." They may be prompted to log in or register.
        c.  Upon authentication/registration, the user is presented with an application form.
        d.  The user fills out the form and uploads their resume. The frontend sends a POST request to the Payload API to create a new `Application` document, linking it to the `Job` and the `User`.
        e.  Payload saves the application. A Payload hook triggers a notification to the relevant HR/Hiring Manager.
    4.  All user interactions are governed by role-based access control checks on both the frontend (for UI rendering) and the backend (PayloadCMS API, for data security).
