### Fixed - Timeline Translation Keys & JSON Validation

#### üîß Critical Timeline Display Issue Resolution

- TermsTimelineContent.tsx incorrectly using `license.sections.*` instead of `terms.sections.*`
- JSON validation warnings due to "#" character in address strings

**Fixes Applied**:

**Translation Keys Added**:
```json
// English (en.json)
"privacy.timeline.title": "Privacy Policy",
"privacy.timeline.subtitle": "Your data privacy and protection",
"terms.timeline.title": "Terms of Service", 
"terms.timeline.subtitle": "Rules and regulations for website usage",
"license.timeline.title": "License Agreement",
"license.timeline.subtitle": "Terms and conditions for using our services"

// French (fr.json)
"privacy.timeline.title": "Politique de Confidentialit√©",
"privacy.timeline.subtitle": "Protection et confidentialit√© de vos donn√©es"

// Spanish (es.json)  
"privacy.timeline.title": "Pol√≠tica de Privacidad",
"privacy.timeline.subtitle": "Protecci√≥n y privacidad de sus datos"
```

**Component Fixes**:
- Fixed `TermsTimelineContent.tsx` to use proper `terms.sections.*` translation keys
